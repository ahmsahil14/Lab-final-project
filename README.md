Here I've created a game named Wordy Nerdy. It's a fun word-related game. It is a classic word-guessing game where wit meets strategy. Can you decode the hidden word before the stick figure takes shape? Challenge your vocabulary and have fun unraveling the mystery word letter by letter. A timeless game of words and deduction!

Description: 
To play, players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. Each correct guess increases the chance of winning a match. After each game, the player's profile is updated with the number of matches played.

The main menu offers an easy-to-navigate experience with options to sign up, view the player profile, or play a new game. It's a text-based adventure that brings the joy of guessing words to your fingertips.

Enjoy the game, track your progress, and have fun unraveling words in this simplified Wordy Nerdy adventure!
